priimitive datatype
7 types  :String,boolean,number,null,undefined,symbol ,BigInt
symbol is used to make something unique
non primitive  and reference type  

->two datatypes primitive and reference(non primitive)[arrays,objects,functions].
no special type for decimal it is same as number

->return type of all non primitive datatypes is functions and return type of functions is known as function objects,
but when u use typeof method we get type as  "object" !!!

->javascript is a dynamically typed language...
